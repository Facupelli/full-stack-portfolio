    title: "Boletin Oficial",
    description:
      "A web app that automatically downloads Argentina's Boletin Oficial daily, uses AI to generate easy-to-read summaries, and highlights relevant news categorized for citizens. Features an AI assistant that can answer questions about the full document in real time.",
    images: [BoletinOficial],
    technologies: ["Astro", "Python", "FastAPI", "Google IA", "SQLite"],
    motivation:
      "I am not a fan of watching the news, but I believe it's important to stay informed about what's happening in your country. With so many rapid changes in Argentina's government, I built this tool to stay up to date without the noise or bias of traditional media.",

    id: 2,
    title: "Dividir Gastos Bot",
    description:
      "A conversational bot that uses AI to manage shared expenses in a group. It understands natural language messages and keeps track of who paid what. The bot can fairly split costs between group members and adjust balances accordingly.",
    images: [ExpensesBotQR, ExpensesBot],
    websiteUrl: "https://t.me/divide_gastos_bot",
    technologies: ["Typescript", "Express", "OpenAI", "SQLite"],
    motivation:
      "I wanted to build something where AI actually made sense not just as a gimmick. Splitting expenses in a group is a common real-life problem, and using natural language to handle it feels intuitive. We're all used to chatting, so why not let the AI understand those chats and help with the division?",
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    title: "Corrala Studio",
    description:
      "A comprehensive platform connecting filmmakers with video editors through dedicated project managers. Streamlines the entire video workflow by managing briefs, revisions, and final delivery to ensure smooth collaboration between creative teams.",
    images: [CorralaStudio],
    websiteUrl: "https://corralastudio.com",
    technologies: ["Next.js", "PostgreSQL", "Cloudflare R2 - KV", "Supabase"],
    motivation:
      "A filmmaker friend and I noticed a common gap between filmmakers and editors, the final product is always better when each person focuses on what they truly enjoy. This platform is our solution to bridge that gap, so both sides can do their best work and stay happy doing what they love.",
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    title: "Social Movies Club",
    description:
      "This is a social platform for movie enthusiasts to rate movies, share their opinions, and discover new films through their friends' activity. Whether you're looking to keep track of the movies you've watched or explore recommendations from your network, this app has you covered.",
    images: [SocialMoviesClub],
    websiteUrl: "https://social-movies-club.vercel.app/",
    technologies: ["Next.js", "PostgreSQL", "Redis", "NestJS"],
    motivations:
      "This app is my way of learning how to build a small-scale social network while scratching a real itch: finding actually good movies to watch. The best recommendations I ever get come from friends whose taste I trust—so I’m wiring that experience into code. Expect rough edges, frequent tweaks, and a lot of fun experiments along the way!",
